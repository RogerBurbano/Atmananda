        content="atma(self)—ananda(bliss) no one has the power to give you bliss; only you can elevate yourself to total self-bliss. “Meditation is what you are. It is our natural state of being. It is that constant silence in the presence of sound. It is that constant stillness in the presence of movement. It is that background in the presence of thoughts that arise from moment to moment. It is the unchangeable in the presence of change. Meditation is an essential practice of yoga in the form of mental hygiene. Think of it as a form of deep rest for the mind while in a conscious state. During meditation, the mind lets go of anxiety and agitation and becomes calm and peaceful.">

                            I was deeply moved by power of practice and
                            connecting to deeper understanding of my body as way to heal physical and mental tension
                            that I gained from continuous practice.
                            I discovered the life-changing benefits of yoga and is now thrilled to share my love and
                            practice of yoga
                            with others to help anyone grow in this beautiful, and healing tradition. With focus on
                            alignment, breath to movement connection,
                            and meditation, my intention is to create a loving space for students of any level to grow,

                        <p>
                            I recently completed my 200 hour Yoga Teacher training at Atmananda Studio, where I am
                            currently teaching
                            as well as completing my 500 hours. I specialize in Atmananda Yoga Sequence, with focus on
                            body alignment and breath.
                            Which are extremely important as it's the safest and most beneficial way for your body to
                            fully experience each pose.
                            Then only, can we truly embark on our journey of going inward, connecting our mind, body,
                            and soul, also known as Yoga.
