        content="atma(self)—ananda(bliss) no one has the power to give you bliss; only you can elevate yourself to total self-bliss. “Meditation is what you are. It is our natural state of being. It is that constant silence in the presence of sound. It is that constant stillness in the presence of movement. It is that background in the presence of thoughts that arise from moment to moment. It is the unchangeable in the presence of change. Meditation is an essential practice of yoga in the form of mental hygiene. Think of it as a form of deep rest for the mind while in a conscious state. During meditation, the mind lets go of anxiety and agitation and becomes calm and peaceful.">

            <h2>Atmananda Alignment Mat</h2>
            <p>
                the atmananda yoga mat
                One of the ways in which Jhon T has revolutionized the
                idea behind proper body alignment in yoga asanas is
                by creating The Atmananda Yoga Mat. The Atmananda
                Yoga Mat is specifically designed to be proportionate
                to students' body heights. The lines and shapes on the
                mat have been calculated to keep the body in perfect
                alignment during yoga practice, and, as such, achieve the
                maximum benefit out of each pose.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Here's how it works:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The horizontal line located one inch from the front edge
                        of your mat is called “The 1st Line.” When asked to stand
                        at the the front of your mat, always maintain your toes
                        directly behind The 1st Line. When called into positions
                        such as Downward Facing Dog or Plank, always maintain
                        your middle finger directly behind The 1st Line. Using The
                        1 st Line as a home base, the yogi is able to find mental
                        clarity and stability via a solid starting and ending place for
                        any sequence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vertical line that runs down the center of your mat
                        is called “The Middle Line.” This line represents your
                        spinal cord, solar plexus, navel, pubic bone, and nasal
                        bone. The Middle Line maintains your body in perfect
                        harmony and symmetry with the mat so that both sides
                        of your mind and body develop evenly. The Middle Line
                        also serves as a good reminder to maintain a straight and
                        healthy spine throughout your yoga practice. The two
                        lines that run approximately 8 inches vertically from the
                        1st line and frame the Middle Line are called The Parallel
                        Lines. Hug the insteps of your feet to The Parallel Lines
                        when you are practices postures like Mountain Pose or
                        Standing Forward Bend. The Parallel Lines maintain your
                        feet a comfortable hips' distance apart so that you can
                        sense more stability in your yoga practice.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Working your way from the front of the mat to the back,
                        the second horizontal line you see is called “The 2nd
                        Line.” This line is an excellent marker to set yourself up
                        for arm balancing postures such as Crow, Side Crow, and
                        Peacock. For example, to practice Crow Pose, simply
                        maintain your middle fingers in line with The 1st Line, and
                        your toes on top of The 2nd Line. Then, place your knees
                        on top of your triceps and balance on your hands with the
                        feet off of the floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The Diagonal Lines” and “the Triangles” that you see
                        toward the back of your mat are useful for all positions
                        that require your back foot to be at a 45 degree angle
                        (Warrior 1, Pyramid, Revolved Triangle, etc.) Simply place
                        the ball of your foot inside the triangle and then spiral your
                        heel down toward the base of the Diagonal Line.The end
                        result will have your foot placed perfectly on the diagonal
                        line with your heel at the point where the Diagonal Line
                        and the Middle Line meet. Proper use of the Triangles
                        and the Diagonal Lines ensure injury prevention in the
                        knees and steadiness in the hips, among other benefits.
                        When practicing postures such as High Lunge, place your
                        back toes inside the Circle in order to properly and safely
                        stretch your iliopsoas (the front of your hip).
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="Text">
                For a healthy practice of poses such as Plank and
                Downward Dog, always maintain your toes inside the
                “XBoxes,” directly in line with the 3rd Line. This practice
                ensures a healthy stretch of the achilles tendons,
                hamstrings, and calves. The 4th Line can also be used as
                a point of reference when you are asked to ground your
                back foot at a 90 degree angle (Warrior 2, Extended Side
                Angle Pose, etc.).
                Overall, proper use of these lines and boxes ensures that
                you do not overextend yourself in the yoga postures.
                Likewise, they will prevent you from cutting your own
                potential short. Finding this balance will facilitate a happy,
                healthy, and most importantly, sustainable yoga practice.
                Yoga Asana: a yogic position that is held firm, but
                relaxed, for extended periods. (Ex: downward facing dog,
                peacock pose, handstand, etc.)
